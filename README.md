# ColorPalettes.jl

Hi, this is just a quick-n-dirty Julia script for me to convert some colour palettes / colormaps I found online to the floating point representations, so that I can import them into OriginPro for plotting...

(Actually I'm surprised you actually even stumbled onto this ðŸ˜†)

## `converted` files
`.PAL` files are Palette files, and are stored by default in `\Documents\OriginLab\User Files\Palettes`

`.OTH` files are Color list files, and are stored by default in `\Documents\OriginLab\User Files\Themes\Graph`
